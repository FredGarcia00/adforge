## The "Sauce" - What Makes It Work

### Account Warming (Critical)
- New/dormant accounts need **5-7 days of warming** before posting
- Warming = scroll FYP, engage, like, comment for 20-30 min daily
- NO posting during warm-up period
- Treat it like your personal account

### If Getting 0 Views
1. STOP posting immediately
2. Re-warm account for 5-7 days
3. Post once, expect 150-300 views
4. Test waters before ramping up

### Posting Strategy
| Phase | Frequency | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Weeks 1-2 | 1-2x daily | Start slow, be consistent |
| After 2 weeks | 1-3x daily | Only increase if maintaining consistency |

**Key insight:** "Consistency beats volume. Easier to post 1x/day than try 3x/day immediately."

### Content Strategy
- Create valuable, **evergreen content** in your niche
- Content must feel organic, natural, authentic
- At 500-1000 views: identify top-performing hooks/narratives
- Double down on what works (learn, apply, repeat)

### Selling Approach

**Soft Sell:**
- Mention product/service subtly, casually, friendly
- Should NOT feel like an ad
- Example: Include your tool in a "my favorite stack" listicle

**CTA (Call to Action):**
- Direct instruction: "Click link in bio", "Find on App Store", "Visit website.com"
- More aggressive but can work well

**Link in bio:** Helps conversions but not required

### Image Sourcing
- **Tumblr** - Blogs group similar aesthetic photos together
- **Pinterest** - Boards organize by theme/aesthetic
- **Instagram** - Niche pages for inspiration
- Search niche keywords to match aesthetics
- Only run ads with images you OWN
